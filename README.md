# soulbound
Game create by @kovuko and @Josue-SR during a google summer camp. This is a stick fighting game that we developed in 1 week using a library called p5.js. What we did in this project was create or own library that created stick figure characters when creating a new instance. We had to learn about the p5.js library and other libraries inside the p5.js library. I was mostly in charge of some of the back end work and most of the front end work. We worked around 25 hours on this game.
