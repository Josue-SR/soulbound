Game create by @kovuko and @Josue-SR during a google summer camp. This is a stick fighting game that we developed in 1 week using a library called p5.js. This was not finish so it is still in development. What we did in this project was create or own library that created stick figure characters when creating a new instance. We had to learn about the p5.js library and other libraries inside the p5.js library. I was mostly in charge of some of the back end work and most of the front end work. We worked around 30 hours on this game and it came out pretty good for the 1 week deadline we had.
